## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the automation of network device configuration using **Ansible**.  
The aim is to reduce manual configuration effort, minimise human error, and apply Infrastructure as Code principles to network management.

A virtual Cisco router was used to design, implement, and test the automation solution in a controlled environment suitable for demonstration.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Ansible  
- Cisco IOS (Virtual Router – e.g. CSR1000v)  
- SSH  
- GitHub (Version Control and Collaboration)  
- Discord (Team Communication)

Additional tools and features may be integrated as part of extended research and implementation.

## Automation Scope
The automation scope was deliberately kept focused to ensure reliability and clarity during demonstration.  
The following configurations are automated:
- Hostname configuration  
- IP addressing  
- SSH configuration
